# Housing-Price-Detection
Housing price detection, or housing price prediction, is the process of using data and machine learning techniques to predict the price of a house or property based on various features or characteristics.

The idea is to build a model that can take data about a property (e.g., square footage, number of rooms, location, etc.) and predict its market price. This is typically done using historical data, where the prices of previously sold houses are used to identify patterns and relationships that can help forecast future prices.

Key Steps in Housing Price Prediction:
Data Collection: Gather historical housing data with details like property features and their corresponding prices.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data (e.g., handle missing values, convert categorical data into numerical values).
Model Training: Use machine learning models (like regression or decision trees) to learn the relationship between property features and prices.
Prediction: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the price of new houses.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like MAE or RMSE.
